# titanic-classification
Titanic Classification :
Build a predictive model to determine the
likelihood of survival for passengers on
the Titanic using data science techniques
in Python.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
there is one predefined dataset available titanic dataset based on that dataset we predict the survival rate so write code based on that
having some features so based on this  features write a code for data science internship task and read only one csv file that is titanac dataset
1. survival-Survival 10 = No 1 = Yes )

2. class Passenger Class ( 1 = 1st 2 = 2nd 3 = 3rd )

3. name-Name

4. sex-Sex

5. age-Age

6. sibsp-Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard

7. parch-Number of Parents/Children Aboard

8. ticket-Ticket Number

9. fare-Passenger Fare

10. cabin Cabin

11. embarked - Port of Embarkation chi( C = Che : Q = Q Queenstown; S = Southampton)

12. boat-Lifeboat (if survived)

13. body-Body number (if did not survive and body was recovered
